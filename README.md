# Technical Report

Please include the following in your technical report:

## Model Architecture and Training

- Architecture details: Highlight the architectural details of your model and how it was implemented.
- Training methodology: Provide number of epochs, learning rate, loss function, and other relevant hyperparameters.
- Optimization: Mention any optimization algorithms or techniques used (e.g., mini-batch gradient descent, Adam).

## Evaluation

- Metrics: Present the accuracy metric(s) you used to evaluate your model, and why. 
- Comparative insights: Discuss the model’s performance. For example, if the model has higher recall but lower precision, explain what that meand with an analysis.
- Error analysis: Identify which classes were most frequently confused and discuss any model-specific reasons behind these misclassifications.
- Strong classes: Highlight well-recognized classes and speculate on why they were successful.
- Depth effects: Reflect on how depth (for Decision Tree, MLP, and CNN) influenced performance (if applicable). Did it capture more detailed features or lead to overfitting?
- Size & kernels: Discuss how layer size (MLP) and kernel size (CNN) variations affected recognition ability (if applicable).
- Summary: Conclude with the primary findings: which model performed best and why.

## Deliverables

You are expected to have your code uploaded to your team's dedicated Github repository. No modifications to the code is allowed after the project deadline.

### Python Code
- All Python scripts developed for this project.
- Code must be well-commented and modular for easy understanding and evaluation.
- Code must be fully functional and runnable. Persistent or unresolvable errors may impact your grade.

### README
- Provide a comprehensive README.md that (i) enumerates the contents and describes the purpose of each file, (ii) clearly outlines the steps to execute your data pre-processing code, and (iii) describes how to train, evaluate, and apply the model.
- 
If instructions are incomplete and your code cannot be run, you may not receive marks for your work.

# Project Contribution and Grading Policy

By default, all team members receive the same grade based on the expectation of active contribution and collaboration. If contributions are disproportionate, the following dispute process applies:

- Internal resolution first: The team must attempt to resolve the dispute internally through open dialogue and clear communication.
- Escalate to POD: If unresolved, approach the POD (acting as project manager) for guidance and mediation.
- Escalate to instructor: If still unresolved after the POD’s intervention, the team may ask the TA to escalate to the course instructor.
- Evidence required: Provide clear evidence delineating individual contributions—ideally version-control records such as GitHub change logs, commit messages, pull requests, and code reviews. Note: More commits ≠ greater contribution; quality, relevance, and impact will be evaluated.
- Written statement: Submit a statement detailing the dispute, perceived uneven contribution, prior resolution attempts, and POD involvement.
- Instructor decision: The instructor will review the evidence and statements and may adjust individual grades. This decision is final.
- Deadlines: Claims regarding contribution after the final (late) submission deadline for each project part will not be considered.
- 
Teams are strongly encouraged to maintain regular communication with the POD to preempt conflicts and ensure smooth progress. The goal is fairness, not to encourage disputes.

# Academic Integrity Guidelines for the Project

Upholding academic integrity is essential. The following guidelines apply:

- Originality of Work
-- All submissions must be the original work of the team.
-- Copying or adapting work from other teams is strictly prohibited.
-- Using external sources without proper citation is prohibited (including ChatGPT and similar tools; see below).
-- Violations may result in a failing grade or other disciplinary actions per the Academic Code of Conduct: https://www.concordia.ca/conduct/academic-integrity.html
-- Not knowing the code is not a valid defense.
